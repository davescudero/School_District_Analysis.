# School District Analysis.
## Overview of the project
A school board has notified evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered, so they have asked me to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact, and repeat the analysis using Jupyter Notebook, Pandas and Python to make sure everything is fine.
## Resources
Data Source: PyCitySchools
Software: Python, Jupiter Notebook, Pandas, VSC
## Analysis and Results
We had to cleanup the data and replace reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School with NaNs.

1. How is the district summary affected?
  - The only change is a little drop in math average between the two analyses
  
- The Thomas High School´s overall passing rate change due to Cleanup, showing us a lower result (65%)
- Removing Thomas High School 9th Grade reduces the "% Passing Math", "% Passing Reading" and "% Overall Passing" scores for size bucket, wich also results in reduction for spending bucket ("630-644")
- How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
